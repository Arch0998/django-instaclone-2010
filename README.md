   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash

4. **Configure environment variables**

   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret
   ```

   **🔑 How to get these values:**


   **Django Secret Key:**
   - Generate a new secret key using Django's built-in function:
   ```python
   python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
   ```
   - Or use online generator: https://djecrety.ir/

### ⚠️ Important Notes
